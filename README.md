# hack-at-home
## Description

Website for Full Stack @ Brown's first hackathon held virtually in the fall of 2020. There is both a 2D version and a 3D version. 
The 3D Version is an 8 sided house that has interactive furniture with all the functionality of the 2D website in terms of working links, video playback, etc.
